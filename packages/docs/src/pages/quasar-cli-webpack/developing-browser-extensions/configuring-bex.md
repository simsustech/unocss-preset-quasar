title: Configuring BEX
desc: (@quasar/app-webpack) How to manage your Browser Extensions with Quasar CLI.
---

Before we can configure anything, we need to understand how the BEX is structured. A BEX can be one (or more) of the following:

1. Runs in its own tab in the browser
2. Runs in the [Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) window.
3. Runs in a [Popup](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui#popups) window.
4. Runs as [Options](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page) window.
5. Runs in the context of a web page (injected into a website)

You do not need a new Quasar App per BEX type above as a single Quasar Application can run in **all** of the instances above. You can find out more about these in the [types section](/quasar-cli-webpack/developing-browser-extensions/types-of-bex).

## quasar.config file

```js /quasar.config file > sourceFiles
// should you wish to change default files
sourceFiles: {
  bexManifestFile?: 'src-bex/manifest.json',
}
```

```js /quasar.config file > bex
bex: {
  /**
   * The list of extra scripts (js/ts) not in your bex manifest that you want to
   * compile and use in your browser extension. Maybe dynamic use them?
   *
   * Each entry in the list should be a relative filename to /src-bex/
   *
   * @example [ 'my-script.ts', 'sub-folder/my-other-script.js' ]
   */
  extraScripts?: string[];

  /**
   * Extend the Esbuild config that is used for the bex scripts
   * (background, content scripts, dom script)
   */
  extendBexScriptsConf?: (config: EsbuildConfiguration) => void;

  /**
   * Should you need some dynamic changes to the Browser Extension manifest file
   * (/src-bex/manifest.json) then use this method to do it.
   */
  extendBexManifestJson?: (json: object) => void;
}
```

## UI in /src

Should you want to tamper with the Webpack config for UI in /src you have two options:

```js /quasar.config file
build: {
  extendWebpack(webpackCfg) { ... },
  chainWebpack(webpackChain) { ... }
}
```

The UI files will be injected and available as `www` folder when you build (or develop) the browser extension.

## Manifest.json

The most important config file for your BEX is `/src-bex/manifest.json`. It is recommended that you [read up on this file](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) before starting your project.

When you first add the BEX mode, you will notice that the manifest file contains three root props: `all`, `chrome` & `firefox`. The manifest for chrome is deeply merged from all+chrome, while the firefox one is generated from all+firefox. You could even have different manifest versions for each target:

```json /src-bex/manifest.json
{
  "all": {
    "manifest_version": 3,

    "icons": {
      "16": "icons/icon-16x16.png",
      "48": "icons/icon-48x48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon-128x128.png"
    },

    "permissions": [
      "storage",
      "tabs"
    ],

    "host_permissions": [ "*://*/*" ],
    "content_security_policy": {
      "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "web_accessible_resources": [
      {
        "resources": [ "*" ],
        "matches": [ "*://*/*" ]
      }
    ],

    "action": {
      "default_popup": "www/index.html"
    },

    "content_scripts": [
      {
        "matches": [ "<all_urls>" ],
        "css": [ "assets/content.css" ],
        "js": [ "my-content-script.ts" ]
      }
    ]
  },

  "chrome": {
    "background": {
      "service_worker": "background.ts"
    }
  },

  "firefox": {
    "background": {
      "scripts": [ "background.ts" ]
    }
  }
}
```

::: warning For TS devs
Your background and content scripts have the `.ts` extension. Use that extension in the manifest.json file as well! Examples: "background.ts", "my-content-script.ts". While the browser vendors do support only the `.js` extension, Quasar CLI will convert the file extensions automatically.
:::

## Background And Content Scripts

Behind every BEX is a [content script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts) and a background script (manifest v2) / service-worker (manifest v3+). It's a good idea to understand what each of these are before writing your first BEX.

In summary:

* **Background Script** - runs in the context of the BEX itself and can listen to all available browser extension events.
* **Content Script** - runs in the context of the web page. There will be a new content script instance per tab running the extension.

::: tip
Given content scripts run in the web page context, this means that only BEX's that interact with a web page can use content scripts. Popups, Options and Devtools **will not** have a *content script* running behind them. They will all however have the *background script*.
:::

::: warning
In Chrome with [Manifest v3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) your background script is actually a Service Worker. This does not currently apply to Firefox with Manifest v3 (yet).
:::

## CSS

Any styles you want to be made available to your web page (not your Quasar App) should be included as a file in `src-bex/assets/<name>.css`. When adding such a file, please make sure that you reference it from your `/src-bex/manifest.json` around the content scripts that need it:

```json /src-bex/manifest.json
// example linking /src-bex/assets/content.css
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": [ "<all_urls>" ],
    "css": [ "assets/content.css" ],
    "js": [ /*...*/ ]
  }
]
```

::: warning
This must be native CSS as it's not preprocessed via Sass.
:::

## Dynamic/other scripts

Should you need other scripts to be dynamically loaded or compiled for your BEX, you can add them by editing your quasar.config file:

```js /quasar.config file
bex: {
  /**
   * The list of extra scripts (js/ts) not in your bex manifest that you want to
   * compile and use in your browser extension. Maybe dynamic use them?
   *
   * Each entry in the list should be a relative filename to /src-bex/
   *
   * @example [ 'my-script.ts', 'sub-folder/my-other-script.js' ]
   */
  extraScripts?: string[];
}
```
