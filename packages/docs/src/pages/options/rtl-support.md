RTL is referring to "right to left" UI for languages that need it.

## Enabling RTL support

### Quasar CLI with Vite
* Edit `/postcss.config.js` file and uncomment the `import rtlcss from 'postcss-rtlcss'` line.
* Yarn/npm/pnpm/bun install the `postcss-rtlcss` package.
* If you are already running "quasar dev" command, restart it.

```js [highlight=2,25] /postcss.config.js
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'
import rtlcss from 'postcss-rtlcss'

export default {
  plugins: [
    // https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer
    autoprefixer({
      overrideBrowserslist: [
        'last 4 Chrome versions',
        'last 4 Firefox versions',
        'last 4 Edge versions',
        'last 4 Safari versions',
        'last 4 Android versions',
        'last 4 ChromeAndroid versions',
        'last 4 FirefoxAndroid versions',
        'last 4 iOS versions'
      ]
    }),

    // https://github.com/elchininet/postcss-rtlcss
    // If you want to support RTL css, then
    // 1. yarn/pnpm/bun/npm install postcss-rtlcss
    // 2. optionally set quasar.config.js > framework > lang to an RTL language
    // 3. uncomment the following line (and its import statement above):
    rtlcss()
  ]
}
```

### Quasar CLI with Webpack
To enable it, you need to edit the `/quasar.config` file:

```js
build: {
  rtl: true
}
```

### Vite Plugin

You first need to install `postcss-rtlcss` package:

```tabs
<<| bash Yarn |>>
$ yarn add --dev postcss-rtlcss
<<| bash NPM |>>
$ npm install --save-dev postcss-rtlcss
<<| bash PNPM |>>
$ pnpm add -D postcss-rtlcss
<<| bash Bun |>>
$ bun add --dev postcss-rtlcss
```

Then create `/postcss.config.js` file if you don't have it already, and add this to it:

```js
import rtlcss from 'postcss-rtlcss'

export default {
  plugins: [
    rtlcss({ /* opts */ }) // <<<< in "plugins"
  ]
}
```

### Quasar UMD
To enable RTL UIs in UMD you need to include the RTL equivalent CSS tag for your Quasar version and also pack in a Quasar RTL language pack (like Hebrew or Farsi). Example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <!-- Replace "2.0.0" (below) with your Quasar version. -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quasar@2/dist/quasar.rtl.prod.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  </head>

  <body>
    ...

    <!--
      We also need an RTL Quasar language pack; let's take Hebrew as an example;
      include this after Quasar JS tag;
      Replace "2.0.0" (below) with your Quasar version.
    -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quasar@2/dist/lang/he.umd.prod.js"></script>
    <script>
      Quasar.Lang.set(Quasar.Lang.he)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Check what tags you need to include in your HTML files by using our [UMD tag generator](/start/umd) and making sure that you tick the "RTL CSS support" checkbox.
Also notice the `<html dir="rtl">` tag at the beginning of the generated html file -- you'll need that too.

::: warning CAVEAT
Quasar CLI automatically adds equivalent RTL CSS rules for your website/app code, but this is not the case for UMD where Quasar CLI is not being used. You'll have to manage writing the RTL equivalent of your website/app CSS code by yourself. It's only Quasar components that will have this handled automatically.

## How it works
RTL is tightly coupled to [Quasar Language Packs](/options/quasar-language-packs). **When Quasar is set to use an RTL language** (language pack has "rtl" prop set to "true") and **RTL support is enabled** (check the "Enabling RTL support" section above), then the UI will dynamically transform Quasar & your website/app code for RTL.

Let's discuss about each of these requirements:

1. *Quasar needs to be set to use an RTL language*.
  See [Quasar Language Packs](/options/quasar-language-packs) on how you can set a language. You can set a language as default or dynamically set one.

2. *RTL support needs to be enabled*.
  Please double-check the "Enabling RTL support" section above. What this does is it compiles CSS for both your website/app code and for Quasar components and add corresponding RTL CSS rules automatically. Your CSS bundle will slightly increase in size due to the addition of these CSS rules.

3. Optional: *Treat devland source CSS as RTL*.
  By default, Quasar assumes that all styles are written in LTR direction and generates corresponding RTL styles for them. Should you wish to write your own css directly in RTL then you need to:
    * (Quasar CLI with Webpack) set quasar.config file > "build" > rtl > "source" to `rtl`
    * (Quasar CLI with Vite / Quasar Vite plugin) set `postcssRtlCss({ source: 'rtl' })` in /postcss.config.js

## Things to keep in mind

* Both RTL and non-RTL Quasar language packs will work together and dynamically switch to/from RTL. So only choosing an RTL Quasar language pack will trigger the RTL UI for you. You don't need separate builds of your app (one for non-RTL and one for RTL-only). The RTL is dynamically changed for you automatically.
* You can dynamically detect if you are on RTL mode by taking a look at Boolean `$q.lang.rtl`. More info on [The $q object](/options/the-q-object).
* You need to be careful when writing your own CSS. Like mentioned above, if RTL support is enabled then RTL (LTR if postcss-rtl config has "source" set to "ltr") rules will be automatically added based on your CSS code. So writing:

  ```css
  .my-class {
    margin-left: 10px;
    right: 5px;
  }
  ```

  ...will add this rule for RTL:

  ```css
  [dir=rtl] .my-class {
    margin-right: 10px;
    left: 5px;
  }
  ```

  Any CSS rule that refers to "left" or "right" is automatically triggering an equivalent RTL CSS rule to be added.

### Marking CSS rules as exceptions
If you need an exception so your CSS code will not add a corresponding RTL rule, then add this comment:

```css
.my-class {
  margin-left: 10px /* rtl:ignore */;
}
```

...or SCSS with indented form:

```sass
.my-class
  margin-left: 10px #{"/* rtl:ignore */"}
```

...or default SCSS:

```sass
.my-class {
  margin-left: 10px #{"/* rtl:ignore */"};
}
```

Now both RTL and non-RTL UI mode will have `margin-left` prop.

Sometimes you'll need to make exceptions for whole DOM elements / components. In this case, add `dir="ltr"` or `dir="rtl"` HTML attribute to the outermost DOM element / component template:

```html
<div dir="rtl">
  <!--
    this DIV and all its content will use RTL mode
    regardless of Quasar language pack RTL settings
  -->
</div>
```

Or, if you need your RTL UI to use left-to-right (ltr) mode for a DOM element / component:
```html
<div dir="ltr">
  <!--
    this DIV and all its content will use non-RTL mode
    regardless of Quasar language pack RTL settings
  -->
</div>
```
